//    Challenge: Representing Vehicles with Interfaces
//    MVP
//    Create a Vehicle interface with 2 function signatures
//    getSpeed -> returns the speed in miles/h
//    decreaseSpeed -> decrease speed by s miles/h
//    Create a Bike class
//  Class must store it’s speed in km/h
//  Implement the Vehicle interface
//  Create a Car class
//Class must store it’s speed in m/s
//Implement the Vehicle interface
//    Both classes should have constructors that allow you to set the initial speed
//    Both classes must have setters for their attributes
