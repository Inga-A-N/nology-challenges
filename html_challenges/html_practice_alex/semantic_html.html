    <h1>Declarative vs imperative programming</h1>
    <img src="./prog.jpeg" alt="Declarative vs imperative programming">
    <article>Imperative and declarative programming are two of the most popular programming paradigms in software development. Programming paradigms are approaches used to categorize or classify programming languages based on techniques and features they support.</article>

    <h2>Imperative programming</h2>

    <section>Imperative programming is the oldest and most basic programming approach. Within the imperative paradigm, code describes a step-by-step process for a program’s execution. Because of this, beginners often find it easier to reason with imperative code by following along with the steps in the process.

        The step-by-step process contains individual statements, instructions, or function calls. In the programming world, this process is called the control flow.
        
        In other words, you’re interested in how the program runs, and you give it explicit instructions.</section>

        <h2>Declarative programming</h2>

        <section>In contrast with imperative programming, declarative programming describes what you want the program to achieve rather than how it should run.

            In other words, within the declarative paradigm, you define the results you want a program to accomplish without describing its control flow. Ultimately, it’s up to the programming language’s implementation and the compiler to determine how to achieve the results. This places emphasis not on the execution process, but on the results and their ties to your overall goal. In other words, writing declarative code forces you to ask first what you want out of your program. Defining this helps you develop more expressive and explicit code.</section>
